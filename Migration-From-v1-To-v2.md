> [!WARNING]
> It is a major version update. It contains some breaking changes. Please read the migration guide carefully if you want to upgrade from v1 to v2.

> [!WARNING]
> v2 is available in **Beta** only. You may encounter bugs and stability issues.

## Before You Start

- Stop your Uptime Kuma and:
  - Backup your `data` directory.
  - Make sure you have a backup of your `data` directory again.
  - Make sure you have a backup of your `data` directory again and again.
- The migration process could take some time to complete, depending on the size of your database.
  - You should be able to view logs of the migration process in the console.
  - Do not interrupt the migration process.
  - FYI: My Uptime Kuma had 20 monitors and 90 days of data, and it took around 7 minutes to migrate.
- Beta version is not stable and may contain bugs, especially for the first beta release.

## Breaking Changes

- The `:duration` of these badge endpoints now accept values `24`, `24h`, `30d`, `1y` only
  - `<kuma-url>/api/badge/:monitorID/ping/:duration`
  - `<kuma-url>/api/badge/:monitorID/uptime/:duration`
- Dropped support for legacy browsers
- Removed deprecated feature [Backup/Restore from JSON](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/pull/3892). Backing up the `data` directory is currently the only supported backup method.
- Removed deprecated feature [DNS Cache for HTTP monitors](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/issues/3762). Consider using the bundled `nscd` for docker installation.
- Updated default retries for **NEWLY** created monitors from `1` to `0` to prevent user confusion
- Switched `Email (SMTP)` notification subject/body templating from a custom-regex to [LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com/). In LiquidJS,
  - variables are now **case-sensitive**, and
  - **all non-matching variables are ignored**.
  - These are the supported variables: `name`, `msg`, `status`, `heartbeatJSON`, `monitorJSON`, `hostnameOrUrl`. We don't have documentation for these yet, but you can refer to the [source code](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/blob/master/server/model/monitor.js) for the data structure.

### Docker only

- Dropped support for Alpine based docker images (But you still can migrate to v2)
- If your host is using Debian / Raspbian Buster, you should not upgrade. Due to a bug in the libseccomp2 library, it will run into a startup problem. Read more: https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/issues/41#issuecomment-896164516

### Non Docker

- Dropped support for Node.js 14 and 16. The minimum supported version of Node.js is 18. Node.js 20 is recommended.

## Slim vs Full?

Slim version has a smaller image size, it is about ~300MB to ~400MB smaller than the full version.

| Full Version                                                                                                                | Slim Version                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✔️ Embedded MariaDB - Can be used as a low-maintenance, durable and performant storage backend                              | ❌ No embedded MariaDB - but you can still connect to an external MariaDB/MySQL database as storage backend                 |
| ✔️ Embedded Chromium - Can be used for the "Browser Engine" monitor type. Some fonts are also included to improve rendering | ❌ No embedded Chromium - for the "Browser Engine" monitor type, an external chromium instance or further setup is required |

Any big dependencies in the future may be included in the full version only too.

If you don't need the above features, you can use the slim version.

## Rootless vs Non-Rootless?

Rootless tags are for users who wants to run Uptime Kuma without root privileges, but some features may not work as expected.

Known issues:

- ⚠️ Not recommended for upgrading from v1 to v2.
- ⚠️ If file permission is not set correctly, Uptime Kuma will run into startup issues. You should make sure the ownership of the `data` directory is set to the `node:node (1000:1000)` user.
- Docker monitor will not work without proper configuration, as by default it requires root privileges.
- Embedded MariaDB doesn't seem to be working on Docker Desktop (Windows), if the `data` directory is mounted to a Windows folder.

## Migration Steps (Docker)

1. Stop your Uptime Kuma container.

```bash
docker stop uptime-kuma
```

2. Backup your `data` directory.
3. Change the image tag to `louislam/uptime-kuma:beta`.

```bash
docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped -p <YOUR_PORT>:3001 -v <YOUR_DIR OR VOLUME>:/app/data --name uptime-kuma louislam/uptime-kuma:beta
```

4. Check the logs to see the migration process.

```bash
docker logs -f uptime-kuma
```

## Migration Steps (Docker Compose)

1. Stop your Uptime Kuma stack.

```bash
docker compose down
```

2. Backup your `data` directory.

3. Change the image tag to `louislam/uptime-kuma:beta`.

```yaml
services:
    uptime-kuma:
        image: louislam/uptime-kuma:beta
....
```

4. Start your Uptime Kuma stack.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

5. Check the logs to see the migration process.

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

## Migration Steps (Non-Docker)

Beta is not available for non-docker yet.

<!--
1. Stop your Uptime Kuma.

```bash
pm2 stop uptime-kuma
```

2. Backup your `data` directory.
3. Check your Node.js version, the minimum supported version is 18. Node.js 20 is recommended.

```bash
node --version
```

## FAQ

### Can I migrate my existing SQLite database to MariaDB?

Cannot be done directly. You will need to export your data from SQLite and import it into MariaDB using 3rd party tools.

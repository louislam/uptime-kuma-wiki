## (Optional) One more step for Reverse Proxy

This is optional for someone who want to use a reverse proxy.

Unlikely other web apps, Uptime Kuma is based on WebSocket. You need two more headers **"Upgrade"** and **"Connection"** in order to reverse proxy WebSocket.

Please read wiki for more info:
https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/wiki/Reverse-Proxy

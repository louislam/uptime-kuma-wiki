### 🐳 Docker Compose Example

https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/blob/master/docker/docker-compose.yml


### 💪🏻 Without Docker (Recommended for x86/x64 only)

It should supports Linux/Windows/MacOS.

Required Tools: 
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 14  
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) 
- (Optional) [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared)

```bash
# Update your npm to the latest version
npm install npm -g

# Clone the repository
# If you don't want to install Uptime Kuma into your homefolder but instead into a more permanent location, follow the "Create app directory in /opt" steps under **Useful Commands** and then continue here.
git clone https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma.git
cd uptime-kuma
npm run setup

# Option 1. Try it
node server/server.js

# (Recommended)
# Option 2. Run in background using PM2
# Install PM2 if you don't have: npm install pm2 -g
pm2 start server/server.js --name uptime-kuma

```

Browse to http://localhost:3001 after started.

```
# Listen to different port or hostname
pm2 start server/server.js --name uptime-kuma -- --port=80 --host=0.0.0.0
```

#### Useful Commands

```bash
pm2 start uptime-kuma
pm2 stop uptime-kuma
pm2 restart uptime-kuma

# Run at startup
pm2 startup

# Create app directory in /opt for home-independent app storage
cd /opt
sudo mkdir uptime-kuma
sudo chown -R {username}:{username} uptime-kuma # Replace {username} with the username you are currently running the commands with
```

## (Optional) One more step for Reverse Proxy

This is optional for someone who want to use a reverse proxy.

Unlikely other web apps, Uptime Kuma is based on WebSocket. You need two more headers **"Upgrade"** and **"Connection"** in order to reverse proxy WebSocket.

Please read wiki for more info:
https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/wiki/Reverse-Proxy

## Unofficial & Experimental

### ☸️ OpenShift 4 and Kubernetes Helm 3 Chart (Unofficial)

> Note: This Chart relies on a repackaged OCI Container Image, which lets *uptime-kuma* run as **non-root** user. \
> The entire repackage process is automated via GitHub Actions and renovate-bot keeps everything up to date. (feel free to audit it yourself)
